## Hi there 👋

💻 New to GitHub, but not new to dreaming about code.
I recently got access to the tools I needed, and now I’m catching up on all the programming I’ve been dying to learn — self-taught, one step at a time.

Currently diving into Java, OOP, and CLI projects — one line at a time.
Self-taught. Always curious. Forever leveling up. 🎮📈

### 🔧 Tools & Tech Stack
Java • CLI • Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) • Git • IntelliJ IDEA 

### 📌 Goals
- Relearning Java Core concepts (OOP, etc.) - Done💡
- Learning Advance Java Concepts
- Learn GitHub Actions or version control workflows 🔄
- Next Tech stack to learn: Spring Boot
