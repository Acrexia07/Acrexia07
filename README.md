## Hi there 👋

💻 New to GitHub, but not new to dreaming about code.
I recently got access to the tools I needed, and now I’m catching up on all the programming I’ve been dying to learn — self-taught, one step at a time.

Currently diving into Java, OOP, and CLI projects — one line at a time.
Self-taught. Always curious. Forever leveling up. 🎮📈

### 📚 Language & Tools 🛠️
Java • CLI • Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) • Git • IntelliJ IDEA

### 📖 Currently Exploring 🔎
 - Concepts: Functional Programming
 - Build Tools: Maven (up next)
 - Frameworks: Spring Boot (planned)


### 📌 Goals
  - ✅ Relearn Java Core concepts (OOP, etc.)
  - 📘 Learn functional programming concepts
  - ⚙️ Start working with build tools (starting with Maven)
  - 🔄 Understand GitHub Actions and version control workflows
  - 🌱 Begin learning Spring Boot as my next framework
